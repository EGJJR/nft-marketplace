The given PHP code is a simple web application that allows users to manage their NFTs. The code fetches the user's NFTs from the database and displays them on the page in a card layout.

Here are some suggestions for refactoring this code to improve its security, readability, and maintainability:

1. Use prepared statements: The given code uses `mysqli_prepare()`, which is an outdated function that can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if proper sanitization is not implemented. To fix this issue, it's recommended to use PDO or MySQLi's built-in prepared statement functionality, which can help prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Use PHP's built-in escaping mechanism: The code uses `htmlspecialchars()` function to escape special characters in the NFT title and description. However, this function is not sufficient for all cases, as it only escapes a limited set of characters. To ensure that all special characters are escaped properly, it's recommended to use PHP's built-in `htmlentities()` function instead.
3. Use consistent naming conventions: The code uses both camelCase and snake_case variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It's recommended to use a consistent naming convention throughout the code, such as either camelCase or snake_case, to improve readability.
4. Use proper error handling: The given code does not handle any errors that may occur during database queries. To fix this issue, it's recommended to add proper error handling, such as using try-catch blocks and logging the errors.
5. Use a more modern PHP framework: The given code is a simple web application, but it uses the outdated `mysqli_prepare()` function, which makes it difficult to use modern PHP frameworks that provide better security and performance features. It's recommended to migrate the code to a more modern PHP framework, such as Laravel or Symfony, which provides better security features, improved performance, and easier maintenance.
6. Use HTTPS: The given code uses HTTP, which can be vulnerable to eavesdropping and interception attacks. To fix this issue, it's recommended to use HTTPS (HTTP Over SSL/TLS) to encrypt the data transmitted between the client and server.
