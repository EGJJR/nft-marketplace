```
<?php
// Start the session
session_start();

// Destroy the current session and redirect to index.php
session_destroy();
header('Location: ../index.php');
exit;
```
This code is refactored to follow best practices and PSR standards for security, readability, and maintainability. Here are the changes made:

* The `session_start()` function is called at the beginning of the script to start a new session or resume an existing one. This ensures that the session is properly initialized and ready for use.
* The `session_destroy()` function is used to destroy the current session, which cleans up any data associated with the session and invalidates the session ID.
* The `header('Location: ../index.php')` function is used to redirect the user to a new page after destroying the session. The `../` prefix in the URL indicates that the new page should be located one level above the current directory in the file hierarchy.
* The `exit()` function is called after the redirection to stop the script from executing any further code and prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.
